# Level 0 Coding Challenges
### flavour : Python



|Task | Objective|
|---- | ---------|
|0.1 | convert pseudocode into real code.|
|0.2 | convert pseudocode into real code.|
|0.3 | write a function named hello, it needs to take in a string as an argument.|
|0.4 | write a function named even_or_odd your function should take an integer and print in the word “even” or “odd”.|
|0.5 | Write a function that takes in three numbers. These numbers represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function should return the area of a triangle.|
|0.6 | Write a function that takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number. Do this without using any builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch.The function should expect a bunch of numbers, not an array or list.|
|0.6 Bonus| how can you change the code so it can take in any number of numbers? Do this without using builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch. Again, the function should expect a bunch of numbers as input, not an array or list. Please do not write a whole new function. Upgrade your existing function.|
|0.7 | Write a function that takes in a number representing the temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. Write another function that does the opposite (Fahrenheit to Celsius).|
|0.8 | Make a function to convert any number into hours and minutes. (For example, 71 will become “1 hour, 11 minutes; 133 will become “2 hours, 13 minutes.) Most people get this question wrong. Make sure you handle singulars and plurals for both hours and minutes.|
|0.9 | Write a function that takes in a string and then prints out all the vowels in the string. Make sure it can deal with capital letters and small letters. For example, Input: "Umuzi", Output: Vowels: u, i.|
|0.10 | Make a function that takes two strings as input, and outputs the common characters/letters that they share. (For example, Input: ‘house’, ‘computers’ . Output: ‘Common letters: o, u, e, s’).|
